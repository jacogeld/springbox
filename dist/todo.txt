Create Makefile
Create Queue
Create worker
	process 0
	process x != 0

create timer to ensure speed is improved for n=3

create a sequential check (for last character added, like in my bf), and a deep
search where it 'reconstructs' the string and checks at each point


Todos in search.c


Done:
queue frees memory correctly, provided user frees memory after dequeue
